# mona-to-good
 A converter that converts the Mona format to GOOD

# Usage
0. You need python installed in order to use this tool, if you don't know how to, search it on Google
1. Download or clone this reporistory
2. Place the `mona.json` file in the same directory where `converter.py` is located (the name has to be `mona.json`)
3. Run `converter.py`
4. The `good.json` file will appear in the same directory where `converter.py` is located

# Limitations
- Currently only supports converting the artifacts in `mona.json` because the purpose of this tool is to import the artifacts scanned by [yas](https://github.com/wormtql/yas) into [Genshin Optimizer](https://frzyc.github.io/genshin-optimizer/#/characters)
